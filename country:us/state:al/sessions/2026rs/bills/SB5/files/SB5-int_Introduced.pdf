29 Bay on September 7, 1814, to secure the release of Dr. William
30 Beanes, who had been captured after the British burned
31 Washington, D.C.
32 (2) The release of Dr. Beanes was secured, but Key and
33 Beanes were held by the British during the shelling of Fort
34 McHenry, one of the forts defending Baltimore.
35 (3) On the morning of September 14, 1814, after the
36 25-hour British bombardment of Fort McHenry, Key peered
37 through the clearing smoke to see a 42-foot by 30-foot
38 American flag flying proudly atop the fort.
39 (4) He was so inspired to see the enormous flag still
40 flying over the fort that he began penning a song, which he
41 named The Defence of Fort McHenry, to commemorate the
42 occasion, and he included a note that it should be sung to the
43 tune of the popular British melody To Anacreon in Heaven.
44 (5) In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the
45 anthem, which had been popularly renamed The Star-Spangled
46 Banner, be played at military and naval occasions.
47 (6) On March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed
48 a resolution of Congress that officially designated The
49 Star-Spangled Banner as the National Anthem of the United
50 States.
51 (7) For over 100 years, The Star-Spangled Banner has
52 served to inspire generations of patriotic Americans, and it
53 is imperative that students have exposure to this history and
54 inspiration.
