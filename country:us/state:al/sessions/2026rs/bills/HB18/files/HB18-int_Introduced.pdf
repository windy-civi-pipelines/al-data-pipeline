4 SYNOPSIS:
5 Under existing law, after the birth of a child
6 to an unmarried woman in a hospital, an alleged father
7 may execute a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity
8 with consent of the mother. An acknowledgment of
9 paternity constitutes a legal finding of paternity and
10 confers all rights and duties of a parent on the
11 acknowledged father.
12 This bill would provide that, in any proceeding
13 relating to child custody, visitation rights, or child
14 support, a valid voluntary acknowledgment of paternity
15 creates certain rebuttable presumptions in favor of
16 joint custody and shared parenting time.
17 This bill would create a rebuttable presumption
18 in those proceedings that a parent may not remove the
19 child from the state without the permission of the
20 other parent or the court.
21 This bill would also provide exceptions for
22 cases involving domestic or family violence.
