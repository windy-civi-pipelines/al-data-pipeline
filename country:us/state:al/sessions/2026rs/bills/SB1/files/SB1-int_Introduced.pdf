4 SYNOPSIS:
5 Existing law lists tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as
6 a Schedule I controlled substance, but explicitly
7 exempts THC found in hemp.
8 Delta-8 THC, Delta-9 THC, and Delta-10 THC are
9 psychoactive cannabinoids that can be made from
10 hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD).
11 This bill would provide that only
12 nonpsychoactive cannabinoids derived from or found in
13 hemp are exempt from the Schedule I controlled
14 substances list, thus classifying psychoactive
15 cannabinoids as controlled substances.
16 This bill would provide that products that are
17 ingested, whether orally or absorbed through the skin,
18 that contain cannabidiol (CBD) or other nonpsychoactive
19 cannibinoids found in or derived from hemp may only be
20 sold in licensed pharmacies that obtain certification
21 from the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy.
22 This bill would require the Alabama State Board
23 of Pharmacy to inspect pharmacies pursuant to this act.
24 This bill would require testing of consumable
25 hemp products prior to sale.
26 This bill would establish testing protocols for
27 testing of hemp and consumable hemp products.
28 This bill would provide that only consumable

This bill would provide that only consumable
SB1 INTRODUCED
29 hemp products using hemp cultivated in this state may
30 be sold.
31 This bill would also require the Department of
32 Agriculture and Industries to establish a tracking
33 program of hemp and consumable hemp products as well as
34 the testing of these products.

41 Relating to hemp compounds; to require all ingestible
42 hemp products that contain nonpscyhoactive cannabinoids such
43 as cannabidiol (CBD) to be laboratory tested and only sold to
44 the public in licensed pharmacies that obtain a certification
45 from the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy; to establish testing
46 protocols and require safety testing of these products; to
47 limit the sale of consumable hemp products to products
48 containing hemp cultivated within the state; to require the
49 Department of Agriculture and Industries to establish a
50 seed-to-sale tracking system to track hemp cultivation through
51 the production and testing of consumable hemp products; to
52 amend Section 20-2-23, Code of Alabama 1975, to provide
53 further for tetrahydrocannabinol listed as a Schedule I
54 controlled substance; and to repeal Section 1 of Act 2025-385
55 of the 2025 Regular Session, which adds Chapter 12 to Title 28
56 of the Code of Alabama 1975, setting certain restrictions on

SB1 INTRODUCED
197 (a) The Legislature finds the following:
198 (1) New synthetic substances are being created which
199 are not controlled under the provisions of existing state law
200 but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater
201 than that for substances controlled under existing state law.
202 These new synthetic substances are called "synthetic
203 controlled substances or synthetic controlled substance
204 analogues" and can be designed to produce a desired
205 pharmacological effect and to evade the controlling statutory
206 provisions. Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic
207 controlled substance analogues are being manufactured,
208 distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled
209 substances.
210 (2) The hazards attributable to the traffic in and use
211 of a synthetic controlled substance or synthetic controlled
212 substance analogues are increased because their unregulated
213 manufacture produces variations in purity and concentration.
214 (3) Many new synthetic substances are untested, and it
215 cannot be immediately determined whether they have useful
216 medical or chemical purposes.
217 (4) The uncontrolled importation, manufacture,
218 distribution, possession, or use of controlled substance
219 analogues has a substantial and detrimental impact on the
220 health and safety of the people of this state.
221 (5) Synthetic controlled substances or synthetic
222 controlled substance analogues can be created more rapidly
223 than they can be identified and controlled by action of the
224 Legislature. There is a need for a speedy determination of
Page 8

Legislature. There is a need for a speedy determination of
SB1 INTRODUCED
225 their proper classification under existing law. It is
226 therefore necessary to identify and classify new substances
227 that have a potential for abuse, so that they can be
228 controlled in the same manner as other substances controlled
229 under existing state law.
230 (b) The controlled substances listed in this section
231 are included in Schedule I:
232 (1) Any of the following opiates, including their
233 isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters,
