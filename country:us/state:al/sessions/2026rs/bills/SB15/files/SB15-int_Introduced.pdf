607 and interests described in subsection (a), the transferee
608 takes the asset subject to:
609 (1) The assignee's rights in the assets of the

SB15 INTRODUCED
617 (e) If a subordinate security interest or other lien is
618 discharged under this section, the assignee may file a record
619 with the official or office responsible for maintaining an
620 official filing, recording, registration, or
621 certificate-of-title system covering the collateral secured by
622 the security interest or other lien. The record must state
623 that the security interest or other lien is discharged as a
624 subordinate security interest or other lien in connection with

627 interest or other lien.
628 Section 15. Distributions.

648 and are incurred with the protected secured creditor's consent
649 or acquiescence. The protected secured creditor has an
650 unsecured claim under subdivision (g)(2) for the amount of the
651 claim that remains after deducting the amount or value of an
652 asset the protected secured creditor receives under this
653 subsection. To the extent a claim is secured by property the
654 value of which, after the deductions provided under this
655 subsection, is greater than the amount of the claim, the

684 business. Payment shall be limited to the greater of:
685 (1) The amount of the claim allowed as a priority claim
686 ahead of claims of other unsecured creditors under the

689 claims of other unsecured creditors under applicable
690 non-bankruptcy law.
691 (g) After the distributions under subsections (c), (d),
692 (e), and (f), each creditor shall receive a distribution of
693 the assets of the assignment estate in the following order of
694 priority:
695 (1) Unsecured claims entitled to priority ahead of
696 claims of other unsecured creditors under other law; and
697 (2) Unsecured claims not entitled to priority.
698 (h) If the assets available for distribution to claims
699 with equal priority under subsection (g) are insufficient to
700 pay the total amount of the claims with that priority, each
Page 25

pay the total amount of the claims with that priority, each
SB15 INTRODUCED
701 creditor with a claim with that priority shall receive a pro
702 rata distribution of the available assets based on the
703 proportion the amount of the creditor's claim bears to the
704 total amount of the claims with that priority.
705 (i) If the claims entitled to the distribution under
706 subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) are paid in full, the
707 residue shall be distributed to allowed claims evidenced by a
708 late-filed proof of claim, other than a late-filed claim
709 allowed by the assignee under Section 11(b)(2), and, after the
710 allowed claims evidenced by a late-filed proof of claim have
711 been paid in full, as provided in the assignment agreement.
712 (j) An assignee may make interim distributions after

723 assignor:
724 (1) A claim arising from rescission of a purchase or
725 sale of the security or other equity interest; and

728 reimbursement or contribution on the claim.

731 subsection (b) has the same priority as common stock or
732 another common equity interest.
733 Section 17. Liability.
734 (a) An assignor is not personally liable for an act or
735 omission by the assignee.
736 (b) An assignee is not personally liable for an act or
737 omission by the assignor.
738 (c) If an assignor designates a representative that may
739 act on behalf of the assignor under Section 8(b)(4), the
740 representative is exculpated to the same extent as a person
741 acting on behalf of the assignor under other law had there
742 been no assignment, except for an act or omission resulting
743 from the representative's gross negligence or willful
744 misconduct.
745 (d) A term of an assignment agreement relieving the
746 assignee of liability is unenforceable to the extent the
747 agreement relieves the assignee of liability for an act or

749 to the purposes of the assignment or the interests of the
750 creditors of the assignment estate.

756 shared by all creditors or a class of creditors; and
Page 27

shared by all creditors or a class of creditors; and
SB15 INTRODUCED
757 (2) The assignee is personally liable to the assignment
758 estate for a harm shared by all creditors or a class of
759 creditors.
760 (f) An assignee is not liable if, in the performance of
761 the assignee's duties and exercise of the assignee's powers,
762 the assignee relies in good faith on:
763 (1) A record of the assignor;
764 (2) Information, an opinion, a report, or a statement
765 presented to the assignee by the assignor's officer or
766 employee, a committee of the assignor's board of directors, an
767 independent director or manager of the assignor, or another
768 representative of the assignor; or
