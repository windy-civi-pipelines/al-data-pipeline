4 SYNOPSIS:
5 Existing law does not allow a pregnant woman
6 sentenced to incarceration to defer her sentence until
7 after the birth of her child.
8 This bill would adopt the Alabama Women's
9 Childbirth Alternatives, Resources, and Education
10 (CARE) Act to provide that if a woman is admitted to a
11 jail, she must inform the individual conducting her
12 initial intake medical screening if she is pregnant or
13 suspects she may be pregnant and would require the
14 woman to be assessed for pregnancy with a urine
15 pregnancy test within three days of her initial intake
16 medical screening, unless she declines the testing.
17 This bill would require a woman who tests
18 positive for pregnancy to be released on bail, provided
19 that the court determines that the woman does not pose
20 a significant threat to herself or others.
21 This bill would provide that, if a woman is
22 pregnant at the time she is sentenced to incarceration,
23 the court shall include a term of pre-incarceration
24 probation to be served until 12 weeks after the woman
25 gives birth, provided that the court determines that
26 the woman does not pose a significant threat to herself
27 or others.
28 This bill would allow any pre-incarceration term

This bill would allow any pre-incarceration term
HB54 INTRODUCED
29 of probation to be credited to the woman's sentence and
30 would require any pre-incarceration term of probation
31 to be served with certain electronic supervision and
32 without payment of any fines.
33 This bill would require a woman serving a
34 pre-incarceration term of probation to report the loss
35 of her pregnancy to her probation officer and would
36 give the court discretion as to when she should
37 self-surrender following the pregnancy loss.
38 This bill would also require a woman serving a
39 pre-incarceration term of probation to self-surrender
40 12 weeks after the birth of her child and would provide
41 that failure to surrender is a Class A misdemeanor.
