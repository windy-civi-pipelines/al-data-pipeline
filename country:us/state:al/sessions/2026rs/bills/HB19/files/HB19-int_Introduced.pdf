6 Under existing law, it is the policy of the
7 state to assure that minor children have frequent and
8 continuing contact with parents who act in the best
9 interest of their children.
10 This bill would create a rebuttable presumption
11 that: (i) joint legal custody; and (ii) frequent and
12 continuing contact and substantial parenting time with
13 both parents are in the best interest of the child,
14 except in cases of domestic or family violence.
15 If the court does not grant joint legal custody
16 and substantial parenting time, this bill would require
17 the court to make specific findings supporting the
18 determination that the presumptions were overcome.
19 This bill would specify information that must be
20 addressed in the final order of the court, such as
21 division of holidays, communication, and child support.
22 This bill would also remove a provision
23 requiring parents to submit an agreement detailing
24 certain matters relevant to the care and custody of the
25 child.
