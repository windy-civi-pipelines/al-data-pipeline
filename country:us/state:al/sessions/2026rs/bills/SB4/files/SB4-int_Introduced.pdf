34 following:
35 (1) That the United States Supreme Court, in its
36 decision in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), upheld the
37 constitutionality of released time programs for religious
38 instruction for public school students during the school day.
39 (2) That the United States Constitution and state law
40 allows local school districts to offer religious released time
41 education for the benefit of public school students.
42 (3) That the purpose of this section is to incorporate
43 a constitutionally acceptable method of allowing school
44 districts to offer released time classes and, in grades where
45 credit is earned, to award students elective credit for
46 classes taken during the school day in released time programs.
47 (c) As used in this section, the term released time
48 means a period of time during the school day when a student is
49 allowed to participate in an elective course in religious
50 instruction, conducted off school district property, by a
51 private entity.
52 (d) The State Board of Education shall adopt and each
53 local board of education may shall implement a policy
54 forallowing a student to attend released time as an elective
55 course if all of the following are satisfied:
56 (1) The parent or guardian of the student gives written

60 attends.
61 (3) The sponsoring entity makes provisions for and

64 (4) No public funds are expended other than de minimis
65 administrative costs.

67 providing the religious instruction.
68 (e) In grades where credit is earned, a student who
69 participates in released time may earn elective course credit
70 for participation, as provided by rules adopted by the State
71 Board of Education for elective courses. Credit awarded may
72 not exceed normal credit given for an elective course in the
73 particular school system. The State Board of Education shall
74 also adopt minimum standards for class attendance necessary to
75 qualify for credit.
76 (f) A student who participates in religious instruction
77 for elective credit during released time shall be credited
78 with time spent as if the student attended school, and the
79 time shall be calculated as part of the actual school day.
80 (g) Transportation to and from the place of released
81 time, including transportation for any student with
82 disabilities, is the complete responsibility of the sponsoring
83 private entity, parent, guardian, or student and may not be

94 (2) Require local boards of education that adopted
95 policies permitting released time instruction prior to July 1,
96 2026, to amend or alter those policies; provided the policies
