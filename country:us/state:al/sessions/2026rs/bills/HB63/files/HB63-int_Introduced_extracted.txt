4 SYNOPSIS:
5 Existing law does not provide a mechanism for an
7 parental rights of the child's biological parent,
8 except in cases of stepparent or relative adoptions.
9 This bill would create Kylie's Law and authorize
10 the court to allow an individual to petition for
11 adoption of a child if he or she is a de facto parent
12 and the custodial parent of the child consents to the
13 adoption.
14 This bill would treat such adoptions as
15 stepparent adoptions for purposes of applying the
16 Alabama Minor Adoption Code.
17 This bill would also require an individual to
18 establish that he or she is a de facto parent by
19 presenting clear and convincing evidence of certain
20 factors related to the individual's relationship with
21 the child, such as that the individual engaged in
22 consistent caretaking of the child, held the child out
23 as his or her child, and established a parental
24 relationship with the child.
