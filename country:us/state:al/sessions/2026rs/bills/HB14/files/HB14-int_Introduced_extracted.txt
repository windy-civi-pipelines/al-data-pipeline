96 session in the same manner as any other sponsored legislation.
97 (f) If no member of the Legislature elects to sponsor
98 a proposal, or the registered agent determines that no
99 suitable action was taken by any individual in the Legislature
100 on the proposal, the registered agent may resume the
101 initiative process only after the end of the regular session
102 by proceeding to obtain signatures in a final petition format
103 provided by the Secretary of State for qualifying the full
104 text of the proposal for consideration. The final petition

HB14 INTRODUCED
141 of the Senate and the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of
142 Representatives. The proposal shall be presented in bill form
143 and treated in every respect the same as any other bill for a
144 general law except as otherwise provided by this amendment and
145 except that the measure shall not be sent to the Governor nor
146 require the Governor's signature. The Legislature, upon
147 considering the proposal for the enactment of a general bill
148 by the initiative, may not alter or amend the original
149 proposal; however, the Legislature may offer an alternate
150 proposal to be considered in the same manner. If the
151 Legislature does not enact the proposal by 12:01 a.m. of the
152 30th legislative day, the proposal shall be placed on the
153 ballot by the Secretary of State. If the Legislature approves
154 an alternate proposal, both the original proposal from the
155 initiative process and the alternate legislative proposal
156 shall be placed on the ballot. The question shall be submitted
157 to the qualified voters at the first statewide election held
158 90 days or more after the Legislature adjourns. No special
159 election may be called solely for the purpose of a voter
160 initiative. "Enact" as used in this subsection means the
161 proposal is considered for a third reading before each body
162 and is voted upon by each house of the Legislature, in its
163 original form as proposed, by the end of the 29th legislative
164 day. The proposal may be a bill for a new statute, a bill to
165 amend an existing statute, or a bill to repeal an existing
166 statute in whole or in part. Upon enactment in the
167 Legislature, the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the
168 House of Representatives, respectively, shall deliver any
Page 6
House of Representatives, respectively, shall deliver any
HB14 INTRODUCED
169 enactment by the initiative proposal to the Secretary of

173 2022, and shall not be subject to veto of any nature. The
174 initiative proposal for a general law enacted by the
175 Legislature shall become law effective upon delivery to the
176 Secretary of State, or upon the terms of the initiative. If
177 two or more proposals, including an initiative proposal and a
178 legislative alternative for a general law, proposed separately
179 for the initiative procedure or as an initiative and an
180 alternate legislative proposal, relating to essentially the
181 same subject, appear on the ballot and are adopted, the
182 measure that receives the highest number of affirmative votes
183 shall prevail to the extent of any conflict.
184 (i) No measure proposed as a statutory initiative
185 shall be sent to the Governor, but shall be sent directly to
186 the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division, for
187 preparation of a review and comment, including an official
188 summary of the proposal for use on the ballot. Both the ballot
189 title and the official summary for the ballot shall be
190 impartial and not likely to create prejudice for or against
191 the measure and shall be prepared in consultation with the
192 initiative committee and proponents. The initiative shall be
193 sent to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the
194 appropriate election.
195 (j) No law adopted by the initiative under this
196 amendment shall be repealed or amended except by vote of the
Page 7

HB14 INTRODUCED
197 people, unless it is otherwise provided by its terms.
198 Part III. (a) The people may propose a constitutional
199 amendment with statewide application by filing a preliminary
200 petition containing a summary of the proposal with the
201 Secretary of State and proceeding further in the same manner
202 and with the same requirements and following the same
203 procedures as for the petition process and the proposal of a
204 general law outlined in Part II, including the refund of the
205 filing fee, less any administrative expenses incurred, for an
206 initiative that is successfully adopted; provided, however,
207 the petition must be signed by qualified Alabama voters and
208 verified as outlined in Part II. The total number of
209 signatures on the final petition required for a proposed
210 constitutional amendment must equal at least 10 percent of the
211 total votes cast for Governor in the last preceding
212 gubernatorial general election. Each final petition shall
213 contain a minimum number of signatures of qualified Alabama
214 voters from each congressional district in the state equal to
215 1.3 percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the last
216 preceding gubernatorial general election within each district.
217 The Legislature may approve an alternative amendment which
218 shall appear on the ballot at the same time following the same
219 procedure as for a general law in Part II.
220 (b) The proposal and any alternative shall be
221 submitted to the qualified voters at the first statewide
222 election held 90 days or more after the measure qualifies;

177 two or more proposals, including an initiative proposal and a
178 legislative alternative for a general law, proposed separately
179 for the initiative procedure or as an initiative and an
180 alternate legislative proposal, relating to essentially the
181 same subject, appear on the ballot and are adopted, the
182 measure that receives the highest number of affirmative votes
183 shall prevail to the extent of any conflict.
184 (i) No measure proposed as a statutory initiative
185 shall be sent to the Governor, but shall be sent directly to
186 the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division, for
